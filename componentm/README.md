Make sure you include the following entry on your [cabal file's
dependecies](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#build-information)
section.

```cabal
library:

Or on your `package.yaml`

```
dependencies:

## Purpose

This library is intended to be a high level API for the
[teardown](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/teardown) library; it provides a
high level monad interface that helps composition of resource
allocation/teardown in a safe and reliable way.

### Differences with ResourceT

The [resourcet](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resourcet) library provides a
monad transformer that keeps track of allocated resources at runtime making sure
that if an exception happens or the block of execution finishes, the resources
allocated are cleaned up.

The [componentm](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/componentm) library on the
other hand, does not run as a Monad transformer, but rather it gets called at
the very beginning of your application, it builds the _environment_ needed by
your application environment to work (e.g. [Layer
1](http://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/03/22/three_layer_haskell_cake.html)), and
provides helper _bracket style_ functions that cleanup all allocated resources
in the right order when your application terminates either normally or with an
error.

This library is intended to be minimal, providing a few functions that work
reliably among many different kind of projects. If you want to contribute, Pull
Request are very welcome! Please try to follow these simple rules:

* Please create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
* Update the README.md file if necessary.
* Please _do not_ change the version number on your Pull Request.
